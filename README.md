# My Rosalind Solutions

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving, similar to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

To get proper support for [Python 3 type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), you can install the [Pyright extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-pyright.pyright).
